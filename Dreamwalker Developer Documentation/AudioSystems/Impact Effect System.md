Really represents a **physical collision** (or overlap) between two things: **the source** of the impact and **the object it is interacting with**. 

```ad-note
title: Collisions or Overlaps 
When we say collision, we are really representing an interaction between two sources.  This may refer to overlap events with physical volumes, instead of a hit event. 

For example
- overlapping with a reset barrier causing an item to respawn
- the player's spore effects cleansed by overlapping a water body
- cube pickup landing in water
