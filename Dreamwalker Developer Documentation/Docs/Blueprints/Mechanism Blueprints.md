Mechanisms are divided into two groups: Triggers and Listeners.  Triggers are mechanisms that ***react to a player action***, for example a pressure plate reacts to the player placing an object on top of it.  Listener mechanisms are linked to a trigger mechanism, and will ***do something*** when the trigger is activated.
