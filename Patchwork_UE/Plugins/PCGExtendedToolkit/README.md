# PCG Extended Toolkit 

![PCGEx](/Resources/Icon128.png)

# What is it?
### The PCG Extended Toolkit is a plugin for [Unreal engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) (5.3, 5.4) that contains a collection of **low-level PCG Graph elements** offering additional ways to manipulate and control PCG Data in unique ways. Its primary focus is to create spatial relationships between points, and build around them; but it comes with a bunch of other super useful stuffs.

PCGEx allows you to create edge-based structures from points dataset, inside of which you can do pathfinding to generate splines; relax positions, attributes, flag specific types of connections, and much much more. 
It also comes with a set of lower-level, more generic features to manipulate attributes & points with a performance boost that can be up to 150x faster than some vanilla PCG Nodes; as well as highly granular parameters & tweaks.

# Highlights
### Vtx/Edge structures
A new concept of connection between points, enabling entierely new ways of working with PCG

### Pathfinding
Advanced pathfinding utilities with a completely modular heuristics system

### Sampling
Powerful tool to extract, transfer and blend data between groups of points, splines, meshes

### Low level utilities
A lot of simple yet powerful utility nodes ranging from complex sorting, complex partitioning, remapping, advanced filters with chainable conditions, to bitmask operations.

### Thanks
- Kudo to [@MikeC](https://github.com/mikec316) for his reckless experiments with uncooked releases, feedbacks, suggestions. Without him this plugin wouldn't be as useful and stable as it is today.
- The Epic staff in the person of [@Amathlog](https://github.com/Amathlog), for his availability and readiness to help with all things PCG.
- [@MaximeDup](https://github.com/MaximeDup) for making this properly compile on Mac in the early days of the plugin
